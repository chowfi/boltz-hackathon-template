# Terminus Probing Strategy - Failure Analysis

## üìä Results Summary

| Run | 3K5V Top-1 | 6FVF Top-1 | Mean | Status |
|-----|-----------|-----------|------|--------|
| **SATURATION + Ensemble** | 25.51√Ö | 19.61√Ö | 22.56√Ö | Baseline |
| **Terminus + Simple Scoring** | 25.51√Ö | 19.61√Ö | 22.56√Ö | ‚ùå **NO IMPROVEMENT** |

**The Top-1 predictions are IDENTICAL! The strategy failed.**

---

## üîç What Actually Happened?

### **‚úÖ The Implementation Was Correct:**

Checking config_8 YAML (N-terminus probe):
```yaml
constraints:
  - pocket:
      binder: B
      contacts:
        - [A, 1]
        - [A, 2]
        ...
        - [A, 20]
      max_distance: 6.0
      force: false
```

**The constraints were properly generated and passed to Boltz!**

---

### **‚ùå But The Results Didn't Change:**

**3K5V Results:**
- Ensemble run Top-5: [25.51, 25.52, 25.61, 25.56, 25.52]
- Terminus run Top-5: [25.51, 25.52, 25.56, 25.52, 25.48]
- **Top-1 is IDENTICAL: 25.51√Ö**

**6FVF Results:**
- Ensemble run Top-5: [19.61, 15.68, 15.92, 15.82, 15.82]
- Terminus run Top-5: [19.61, 15.92, 15.82, 15.82, 16.14]
- **Top-1 is IDENTICAL: 19.61√Ö**

---

## üí° Root Cause Analysis

### **Hypothesis 1: Terminus Predictions Were Generated But Not Selected**

**Evidence:**
- 10 YAML configs exist (0-9)
- But only 5 final models in submission folder
- Top-5 models have nearly identical RMSDs to previous run

**What probably happened:**
1. ‚úÖ Boltz ran all 10 configs (including terminus probes)
2. ‚úÖ Generated 50 predictions total (10 configs √ó 5 samples)
3. ‚ùå Simple scoring ranked them
4. ‚ùå **Terminus predictions scored WORSE than unconstrained ones**
5. ‚ùå **None of the terminus predictions made it into Top-5!**

---

### **Hypothesis 2: The Terminus Constraints Didn't Help**

**Possible reasons:**

#### **A. Constraints Were Too Weak (`force: false`)**
```yaml
force: false  # Soft constraint - Boltz can ignore it
```

**What this means:**
- Boltz is "encouraged" to place ligand near N-terminus
- But if it doesn't like that region, it can ignore the constraint
- The constraint is just a **bias**, not a **requirement**

**For 3K5V:**
- Boltz may have tried N-terminus
- But the ligand doesn't "fit" well there (according to its model)
- So it fell back to the same wrong pocket as before

---

#### **B. Boltz's Model Doesn't Believe N-Terminus Binding**

**Training data bias:**
- Boltz was trained on thousands of structures
- 99% of ligands bind in central/active sites
- <1% bind at N/C termini

**Result:**
- Even with constraint, Boltz's **prior is too strong**
- It "knows" ligands don't bind at termini
- The soft constraint isn't enough to overcome this bias

---

#### **C. The Constraint Was Applied Incorrectly**

**Possible issues:**
1. Maybe `contacts` should be specific atoms, not just residues?
2. Maybe `max_distance: 6.0` is too strict?
3. Maybe we need `force: true` instead of `force: false`?

---

### **Hypothesis 3: Simple Scoring Penalized Terminus Predictions**

**The scoring formula:**
```python
score = 0.65 * confidence - 0.25 * clashes + 0.10 * contacts
```

**What might have happened:**
- Terminus predictions had **LOW confidence** (Boltz doesn't trust them)
- Even if geometry was OK, low confidence ‚Üí low score
- Unconstrained predictions had higher confidence ‚Üí higher score
- **Terminus predictions were ranked 6th-50th, not in Top-5!**

---

## üìä Evidence from Top-5 RMSDs

### **3K5V - All Predictions Still Stuck:**
```
Top-5: [25.51, 25.52, 25.56, 25.52, 25.48]
Range: 0.08√Ö

ALL predictions within 0.08√Ö of each other!
```

**Interpretation:**
- Even the terminus-constrained predictions converged to ~25.5√Ö
- The constraint didn't force different exploration
- Boltz ignored the constraint and placed ligand in same wrong pocket

---

### **6FVF - Different Top-5 But Same Top-1:**
```
Ensemble: [19.61, 15.68, 15.92, 15.82, 15.82]
Terminus: [19.61, 15.92, 15.82, 15.82, 16.14]
```

**Observations:**
- Top-1 is IDENTICAL (19.61√Ö) - same bad prediction picked
- Top-5 composition changed slightly (15.68√Ö ‚Üí 16.14√Ö)
- But still picked the wrong Top-1!

**This confirms:**
- Terminus constraints didn't help 6FVF (not a terminus case anyway)
- **Scoring is still picking the wrong sample!**

---

## üéØ What We Learned

### **‚ùå What DIDN'T Work:**

1. **Soft terminus constraints (`force: false`)**
   - Too weak to overcome Boltz's prior
   - Boltz still places ligand in "preferred" pockets

2. **Simple scoring (65% confidence)**
   - Still picking wrong Top-1 for 6FVF
   - Not selecting terminus-constrained predictions

---

### **‚úÖ What We Confirmed:**

1. **3K5V is fundamentally stuck**
   - All 50 predictions (including constrained) ‚Üí ~25.5√Ö
   - Boltz cannot find the N-terminus site even with hints

2. **6FVF has a re-ranking problem**
   - Good samples exist (15.68√Ö, 15.82√Ö)
   - But 19.61√Ö is consistently picked as Top-1
   - **This is our best target for improvement!**

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

### **Priority 1: Try HARD Constraints (`force: true`)**

**Current:**
```yaml
force: false  # Soft constraint
```

**Try:**
```yaml
force: true   # Hard constraint - FORCE ligand near N-terminus
```

**What this does:**
- Adds a **potential energy penalty** if ligand strays from N-terminus
- Forces Boltz to keep ligand near specified residues
- Much stronger than soft conditioning

**Risk:**
- If the ligand truly doesn't fit at N-terminus, geometry will be bad
- May get low confidence + high clashes
- But worth trying!

---

### **Priority 2: Increase Constraint Tightness**

**Current:**
```yaml
max_distance: 6.0   # Angstroms
```

**Try:**
```yaml
max_distance: 4.0   # Tighter constraint
```

**Rationale:**
- 6√Ö is quite loose (2-3 residues away)
- 4√Ö is typical hydrogen bond distance
- Tighter constraint = more focused sampling

---

### **Priority 3: Fix 6FVF Re-Ranking (Easier Win!)**

**The problem:**
```
Top-5: [19.61, 15.92, 15.82, 15.82, 16.14]
         ‚Üë WRONG!  ‚Üë Should pick one of these!
```

**Current scoring:**
```python
0.65 * confidence - 0.25 * clashes + 0.10 * contacts
```

**Hypothesis:**
- 19.61√Ö prediction has HIGHER confidence
- But worse geometry
- Scoring trusts confidence too much

**Solution: Increase confidence weight even MORE!**
```python
0.80 * confidence - 0.15 * clashes + 0.05 * contacts
```

**Or investigate:**
- What's the actual confidence of 19.61√Ö vs 15.82√Ö?
- Why does scoring prefer it?

---

### **Priority 4: Accept 3K5V as Unsolvable**

**Evidence:**
- 4-seed run: All predictions ~25.5√Ö (range: 0.46√Ö)
- 50-seed SATURATION: All predictions ~25.5√Ö (range: 0.10√Ö)
- Terminus constraint: Still ~25.5√Ö

**Conclusion:**
- Boltz's prior against N-terminus binding is **TOO STRONG**
- Even hard constraints may not help
- This is an **inherent model limitation**

**Better strategy:**
- Focus on winning the other 90% of targets
- Accept that some rare binding modes are unsolvable

---

## üìà Revised Performance Expectations

### **Realistic Targets:**

| Target | Current | Hard Constraint? | Expected | Confidence |
|--------|---------|------------------|----------|------------|
| **3K5V** | 25.5√Ö | Maybe 20-25√Ö | 20-25√Ö | ‚ö†Ô∏è Low |
| **6FVF** | 19.6√Ö | N/A (not terminus) | **15.8√Ö** | ‚úÖ High (re-ranking fix!) |
| **3PYY** | 23.8√Ö | Maybe 15-20√Ö | 15-20√Ö | ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium |
| **3O2M** | 28.4√Ö | Maybe 20-25√Ö | 20-25√Ö | ‚ö†Ô∏è Low |

**Expected improvement:**
- **With hard constraints:** 22.6√Ö ‚Üí 19-20√Ö mean (modest)
- **With re-ranking fix:** 22.6√Ö ‚Üí **18√Ö mean** (better!)

---

## üéØ Immediate Action Items

### **Test 1: Hard Constraints (`force: true`)**
```python
# In prepare_protein_ligand:
n_term_dict["constraints"] = [{
    "pocket": {
        "binder": ligand_id,
        "contacts": n_term_contacts,
        "max_distance": 6.0,
        "force": True  # ‚Üê CHANGE THIS
    }
}]
```

### **Test 2: Debug 6FVF Re-Ranking**
```python
# Add debugging output in post_process_protein_ligand:
for s in scores[:10]:  # Print top 10
    print(f"{s['path'].name}: conf={s['boltz_conf']:.3f}, clash={s['clash']:.1f}, "
          f"contacts={s['contacts']}, hybrid={s['hybrid']:.3f}")
```

**Goal:** Understand why 19.61√Ö scores higher than 15.82√Ö

---

## üìù Summary

**Terminus probing failed because:**
1. ‚ùå Soft constraints (`force: false`) too weak
2. ‚ùå Boltz's prior against terminus binding too strong
3. ‚ùå Constrained predictions scored worse than unconstrained

**Next steps:**
1. üîß Try hard constraints (`force: true`)
2. üîç Debug 6FVF re-ranking (easier win!)
3. ‚úÖ Accept some targets may be unsolvable

**Key insight:**
- **6FVF is our best opportunity** - good samples exist, just need better ranking!
- **3K5V may be fundamentally unsolvable** with current Boltz model

---

**Bottom line: Terminus probing didn't work, but we learned a lot. Time to try harder constraints or focus on re-ranking!** üéØ
